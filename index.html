            <br />
            Last time I was into coding was in late 90s and had my website back then &amp; now making a come back online
            after nearly 2 and &frac12; decades. Currently learning Front-end web development (HTML5, CSS3 and Java Script) as a hobby to
            further enrich and diversify my skills portfolio.
            <br />
            <br />
            For the time being, I am working on this website using my basic coding skills in HTML and CSS.--->

            My name is M. Akmal Al-Bhatti.
            <br />
            <br />
            I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in March/2020 with an HBA1C of 11.7 &amp; this was when I started my journey searching for a healthy diet/way of eating. All thanks to God, I was able to bring down the HBA1C to 5.3 in 6 months and later took it further down to 4.3 without any medications or medical procedures. I am currently still maintaining it in the healthy range of 5.
            <br />
            <br />
            
            </p>
            
            <p class="para2">During my self-treatment of diabetes, thanks to God and through dietary changes, I also cured Melanoma (a type of skin cancer) and that also without any medication or medical procedure.
            <br />
            <br />
            I don’t consider just lowering HBA1C as a reversal of diabetes, in fact, 2 other tests related to insulin have to be looked into. The 2 insulin-related tests along with HBA1C gives a good overall picture of the condition.
            <br />
            <br />
            Lowering HBA1C is the easiest thing to do whereas lowering other markers positively is much harder and takes a long time to come down back to normal. I am still strictly following the dietary and lifestyle changes I made and thanks to God I’m progressing towards completely reversing diabetes.
            <br />
            <br />
            I would be very happy to help and motivate others positively based on my personal experience by sharing with them what I achieved and that they can also achieve the same results and even more if they want to.
            <br />
            <br /> 
            Some of the topics I can share my experience about are:
            <br />
            • Weight loss • Weight gain • Carb addiction • Blood sugar levels (highs &amp; lows) • Diabetes type 1 &amp; 2.
            <br /> 
            <br /> 
            If you are interested to know more about my experience or would like to get guidance from me in order to reverse/cure your medical condition(s) similar to what I did or you would like to regain your health and get off your medications, please feel free to schedule a free 1st 1 to 1 consultation/advising call with me by <a href=" https://calendly.com/mab290182" target="blank">clicking here</a> and reserving your spot for a talk with me explaining me your condition and giving me the opportunity to share my experience which might help you as well.
            <br />
            <br />
            Please note that I am not a certified nutritionist or physician. I will just be sharing the experience and knowledge I gathered from different experts in the field of proper human nutrition over the course of past 3.5 (three and half years) and guide you to the best of my knowledge and experience in case you would like to try the same dietary and lifestyle changes which helped me medically, physically and mentally positively.
            <br />
            <br />
            Just keep in mind that a healthy yourself will be of help to your family, friends, and society, and an unhealthy yourself will be reliant on your family, friends, and society.
            <br />
            <br /> 
            Looking forward to sharing my experiences with you and wishing you and everyone in your family a healthy, happy, successful, and prosperous life for years to come.
