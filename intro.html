                        My past <span>20+ years of professional work experience on various posts in 5 different
                            companies</span>

                        <br />
                        I am detail oriented by nature and with strong ability to quickly learn new things whether it be
                        related
                        to my work or something different like human languages or programming languages.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Even though I donâ€™t consider myself professional in IT, but due to my natural desire to
                        continuosly
                        learn
                        and try new skills, I try to practically implement new skills learnt to the usual tasks at work
                        place to
                        improve
                        work place efficiences like automation of sending emails using combination of Excel VBA & HTML,
                        creating
                        tracking sheets using Excel formulas and VBA an so on.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I have always positively contributed not to just the departmnt I work in but to my colleagues as
                        well
                        across multiple departments as I am strong believer of team work.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        With my extensive work experience and strong capabilities, I am very confident that if given a
                        chance, I
                        will not only meet but exceed the expectations that an employer would have from me.
